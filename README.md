# ðŸš• Taxi Ride Duration Prediction

`taxi_ride.ipynb` contains code used to predict the duration of taxi rides in Manhattan, NY. I have mainly used the Python pandas and sklearn libraries, where the best outcome was achieved with tree regression. The learning takes place in four distinct parts.

## Data Selection and Cleaning

After collecting a random sample of the original taxi rides data into a SQLite database, I have queried only the rides that occurred within the boundaries of New York City. I have then proceeded to filter the data to exclude abnormal rides and keep only rides that happened on Manhattan island using the point-in-polygon algorithm. Below is a visualization of rides kept as a result.
